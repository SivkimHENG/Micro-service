# Microservice System: Service Mesh

ServiceMesh is a modular, scalable Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform built with Spring Boot microservices.  
It provides a clean, service-oriented architecture with service discovery, API gateway, and independent microservices to manage core business domains such as orders and products.
